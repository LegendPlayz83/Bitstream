# Inspiration
I've always wanted to build such hardware, and Hackpad gave me the perfect opportunity to start hardware creation

# Challenges
This was the first time I used the XIAO library and Fusion 360. Although I did run into some issues, the tutorial helped me a lot as a beginner and other issuses were resolved on the channel <a href="https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07LESGH0B0">Hackpad</a>.
